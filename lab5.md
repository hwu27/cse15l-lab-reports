Hey! Thanks for being detailed in your question.

You might want to double check your inputs in your bash file. Notice how your num1 and num2 is strictly based off args[1] and args[2]?
This assumes that there is an initial input that dictates whether it should be added or subtracted. What happens when that input isnn't there?

Secondly, it seems that there might be another error that you didn't notice. 

Look closely at this:
